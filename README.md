# Budget Allocation App
This project is a React-based solution for efficient company budget management. Easily allocate funds to departments, track total, remaining, and spent budgets, and switch between currencies for global operations. The app includes user-friendly buttons for incremental budget adjustments, offering both speed and precision in financial decision-making. Ideal for businesses of all sizes.

## Contributions

This project was initially based on the foundation provided by the "Developing Front-End Apps with React" course by IBM on Coursera. While the core structure and initial codebase were part of the course, I've made significant contributions and added the following features to enhance its functionality:

- Currency Conversion
- Budget Adjustment
- Custom Department Budget Modifications

I'm grateful for the educational resources that helped me get started, and I'm excited to share the improved version of this app with the community. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
